# SyDEVS

Multiscale Simulation and Systems Modeling Library

## About

This library provides a framework for implementating complex systems analysis and simulation code in a modular/hierarchical fashion. The framework combines two programming paradigms: [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) and [DEVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS). These foundations give the framework the generality neeeded to support essentially any type of simulation, regardless of domain, time scale, or time advancement scheme.
