# SyDEVS

Multiscale Simulation and Systems Modeling Library

## About

The SyDEVS open source C++ library provides a framework for implementing complex systems analysis and simulation code in a modular, hierarchical fashion.

**In a nutshell, it will help make your simulation code scale.**

The framework combines two programming paradigms: [dataflow programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming) and [DEVS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEVS). These foundations give the framework the generality needed to support essentially any type of simulation, regardless of domain, time scale, or time advancement scheme.

## Documentation

- [Main Documentation](doc/html/index.html): Includes both the [Getting Started](doc/html/getting_started.html) tutorial and the API Reference.
- SyDEVS Framework Overview ([PPTX](doc/downloads/SyDEVS_Framework_Overview.pptx), [PDF](doc/downloads/SyDEVS_Framework_Overview.pdf)): Illustrates the main concepts & relates them to code.
- SyDEVS Building7m Tutorial ([PPTX](doc/downloads/SyDEVS_Building7m_Tutorial.pptx), [PDF](doc/downloads/SyDEVS_Building7m_Tutorial.pdf)): Challenges users to learn by enhancing an example.

## Download

Download the latest SyDEVS release [here](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/releases), or fork, clone, and build the [repo](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs).

You will need a C++ compiler that implements the C++14 standard. SyDEVS has been tested successfully with Visual Studio 2015, Visual Studio 2017, and recent versions of GCC and Clang.
