# Composite Nodes

The ***composite node*** integrates other nodes by linking their ports. There are initialization and finalization links, which form a dataflow programming graph. There are also simulation links, which direct messages and support discrete event simulation.

The composite node source code can be found in [composite_node.h](https://github.com/Autodesk/sydevs/blob/master/src/sydevs/systems/composite_node.h).
