[Click here](https://autodesk.github.io/sydevs/doc/html/getting_started.html) to see the tutorial in its current location.

This tutorial will guide you through the steps of creating a simulation project using the SyDEVS library.

You will need a C++ compiler that implements the C++14 standard. If you're relatively new to C++, a list of free compilers and a tutorial are available on the [Standard C++ Foundation's getting started page](https://isocpp.org/get-started). SyDEVS has been tested successfully with Visual C++ 2015 and 2017, the Gnu Compiler Collection, and Clang.
